Protocol Stack
==============

`sup-protocol` provides abstractions that allow application programmers to define and implement application specific interfaces that need to be exposed as a Remote Procedure Call (RPC) over the network. The implementation does not rely on any specific network protocol to avoid direct coupling between application level code and low-level network code.

Architecture
------------

The following image summarizes the relationship between the main classes and interfaces involved in exposing an application specific interface as an RPC:

.. image:: /images/sup_protocol_stack.png

Application Layer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

At the top of the diagram is the application specific code. This code defines an API in the `ApplicationService` interface that the programmer wishes to expose as an RPC. When the `Consumer` class interacts with this interface, it stays unaware of the concrete nature of the implementation. It can be a local implementation of this service ('ConcreteService"), or a remote protocol adapter implemented via `ApplicationProtocolClient` class. The later forwards method calls so they can be handled by a server-side implementation.

To be able to expose the `ApplicationService` as an RPC, the application developers need to implement two concrete classes:

* `ApplicationProtocolClient`: this class translates API calls from `ApplicationService` to the generic method `Protocol::Invoke`, defined as part of sup-protocol;
* `ApplicationProtocolServer`: this class does the inverse. It implements the API of `Protocol`, i.e. mainly its `Invoke` method, and translates its payload to calls on an `ApplicationService` implementation.

The `Protocol` interface contains the following methods:

.. function:: ProtocolResult Invoke(const AnyValue& input, AnyValue& output)

   :return: ProtocolResult indicating success or failure conditions.

   The main API method that provides access to the application layer over the network.

.. function:: ProtocolResult Service(const AnyValue& input, AnyValue& output)

   :return: ProtocolResult indicating success or failure conditions.

   API method that can provide generic application protocol information to the caller.

.. note::
   The `input` parameter for both API methods cannot be empty.

`ProtocolResult` is a simple wrapper around an unsigned integer value that describes success or a failure condition. User applications can extend the existing set with their application specific error conditions. User-defined error codes should start from the value `GENERIC_APPLICATION_ERROR_START` for generic application frameworks and from `SPECIFIC_APPLICATION_ERROR_START` for concrete applications.

The following basic `ProtocolResult` objects are defined in `sup-protocol`:

     - Error when the Protocol server receives a request about an asynchronous request with an unknown identifier
   * - InvalidAsynchronousOperationError
     - Error when the Protocol server receives a request for an asynchronous request that is not valid
   * - ServerProtocolException
     - Error when the Protocol at the server side throws an exception
   * - ClientTransportException
     - Error when the injected transport AnyFunctor on the client side throws an exception
   * - AsynchronousProtocolTimeout
     - Error when an asynchronous request times out

.. note::
   Most predefined `ProtocolResult` objects can be categorized by:
      * `Client` or `Server`: indicates if the error occurred on the client or server side;
      * `Network`, `Transport` or `Protocol`: indicates if the error occurred at the network, transport or protocol layer;
      * `Encoding` or `Decoding`: indicates the direction of the data flow where an error occurred; more specifically, `Encoding` refers to the process of encoding data from a higher layer into a packet for the layer below, while `Decoding` referes to the inverse process.

Protocol and Transport Layer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The protocol and transport layer is defined by `sup-protocol`, as can be seen from the interface definitions in the diagram (`Protocol` and `AnyFunctor`) and the classes that translate between these two layers (`ProtocolRPCClient` and `ProtocolRPCSserver`).

.. note::
   The split into a protocol and transport layer is not strictly necessary, but it allows for a more flexible design. The protocol layer is responsible for defining the structure of the messages exchanged between the client and server, while the transport layer is responsible for defining how these messages are exchanged over the network. This allows for supporting asynchronous communication over a synchronous network protocol.

The translation between the protocol and transport layer is done by the `ProtocolRPCClient` and `ProtocolRPCServer` classes. Multiple transport layer protocols are supported, depending on whether the transport layer is synchronous or asynchronous and whether the payload is encoded or not.

The choice of encoding and (a)synchronous communication is determined by the `ProtocolRPCClient`'s configuration. The server will respect the same transport layer protocol as requested by the client or return an error status if this is not supported.

Synchronous transport layer
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""

If `ProtocolRPCClient` is configured to use synchronous communication over the transport layer, it will create a transport packet that is structured as follows:

.. code-block:: text

   # Without encoding
   struct sup::protocolRequest/v2.1
       query: <payload>
       encoding: int32 0 (optional)

   # With base64 encoding
   struct sup::protocolRequest/v2.1
       query: string <base64 encoded payload>
       encoding: int32 1

where `<payload>` represents the `input` parameter of the `Protocol::Invoke` method. In case no encoding of the payload is used, the `encoding` field is optional and can be omitted. Currently, only two encoding methods are supported:

* No encoding (0)
* Base64 encoding (1): the `input` parameter of the `Protocol::Invokde` method will first be serialized into a binary format that is then base64 encoded into a string.

The `ProtocolRPCServer` object at the server side will unpack this packet to extract the original `input` parameter, possibly using base64 decoding. It will then call the custom `Protocol::Invoke` method of the application and create a return packet as follows:

.. code-block:: text

    # Without encoding
   struct sup::protocolReply/v2.1
       result: uint32 0
       reply: <payload>
       encoding: int32 0 (optional)

   # With base64 encoding
   struct sup::protocolReply/v2.1
       result: uint32 0
       reply: string <base64 encoded payload>
       encoding: int32 1

where `<payload>` now refers to the `output` parameter of the `Protocol::Invoke` method. The `result` field encodes the return value of the `Protocol::Invoke` method.

Asynchronous transport layer
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

For simplicity, in this section all packets are shown without encoding. If base64 encoding would be used, this would add the member field `encoding` to the packet and both `query` and `reply` would be base64 encoded strings.

If `ProtocolRPCClient` is configured to use asynchronous communication over the transport layer, it will first send an initial request packet to the server that is encoded as follows:

.. code-block:: text

   struct sup::protocolRequest/v2.1
       query: <payload or encoded payload>
       async: uint32 0

If the server does not support the asynchronous transport protocol, it will ignore the `async` field and process the request as a synchronous request. If the server does support the asynchronous transport protocol, it will process the request and return a packet that is structured as follows:

.. code-block:: text

   struct sup::protocolReply/v2.1
       result: uint32 0
       reply: struct
           id: uint64 <request_id>
       async: uint32 0

where `<request_id>` is a unique integer identifier for the request.

The client will then poll the server to check if the request has been processed. The polling packets are structured as follows:

.. code-block:: text

   # Poll request
   struct sup::protocolRequest/v2.1
       query: struct
           id: uint64 <request_id>
       async: uint32 1

    # Poll reply
    struct sup::protocolReply/v2.1
        result: uint32 0
        reply: struct
            ready: bool <true/false>
        async: uint32 1

If the poll reply indicates that the initial request has been fully processed, the client will attempt to retrieve the result of this processing by sending a request packet that is structured as follows:

.. code-block:: text

   struct sup::protocolRequest/v2.1
       query: struct
           id: uint64 <request_id>
       async: uint32 2

And the server will return the result of the processing in a packet that is structured as follows:

.. code-block:: text

   struct sup::protocolReply/v2.1
       result: uint32 0
       reply: <payload>
       async: uint32 2

Network Layer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

At the bottom part of the diagram is the network implementation (the diagram uses a concrete EPICS implementation). Every concrete network implemenation should implement the `AnyFunctor` interface:

.. function:: AnyValue operator()(const AnyValue& input)

   The function call operator with an `AnyValue` parameter and return value.

An implementation of the network layer requires:

* The client and server implementations obey the contract of the transport layer. This means that the return values of the function call operator are compliant with the above mentioned reply structures.
